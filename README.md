## Description: 
I was motivated to do this because I wanted to learn how to use bootstrap to set items to local storage, and it was a good way to get my mind working hard.
I built this so people have a place to keep time sensitive notes. You can see your notes and when yoou need to do certain things by.
It allows users to be more organized if they were having trouble with that or not, also it will allow you to see if youve missed something you were supposed to do earlier in the day.
I learned that there is a good use for bootstrap it makes writing back end code all the more easy. It will also help do many other things.
